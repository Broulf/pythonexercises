# Part I

# write a count-controlled WHILE loop to "repeat" 6 times
# count each of the different types indicated in the handout
# they are initialized above

count = 0

while count 
    # repetitive stuff



    
    count = count + 1

print("------------------------")
print("Count of Zeroes:", countZero)
print("Count of Positives:", countPositive)
print("Count of Negatives:", countNegative)

    


# print all the stats




# Part II

# write a count-controlled FOR loop to "repeat" 6 times
# count each of the different types indicated in the handout
# remember to initialize them above

countZero = 0
countPositive = 0
countNegative = 0

# print all the stats





# Part III

# write a sentinel-controlled WHILE loop 
# count each of the different types indicated in the handout
# remember to initialize them above

    
    


# print all the stats
